      <h3 class="text_with_2px_border">Why professionally valet my car?</h3>
      <p>Having a professionally valeted vehicle can make all the difference; some say
      it will go faster! Whether it's for a job interview, wedding, taking friends or
      the in-laws out, having a clean vehicle says positive things about the owner. 
      When it comes to reselling, having your vehicle valeted helps you to achieve a
      much quicker sale and you are more likely to recieve the full asking price.</p>
